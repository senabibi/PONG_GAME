## About The Project



Here's a video demonstrating the Pong Game Simulator in action:

[![Pong Game Demo](https://github.com/senabibi/Pong_Game/blob/main/images/view.gif)

The Pong Game project is a recreation of the iconic Pong video game, which was one of the first arcade games ever created. This project aims to bring the classic Pong experience to modern audiences, allowing players to engage in a simple yet enjoyable competitive game. The objective is straightforward: two players control paddles on opposite sides of the screen, attempting to bounce a ball back and forth and score points by getting the ball past their opponent's paddle. Behind this simplicity lies a valuable learning experience for game development enthusiasts. The project involves essential game development concepts such as real-time physics, user input handling, and collision detection. It's a great starting point for those looking to grasp the fundamentals of game development while also enjoying a timeless classic. Whether you're a beginner seeking an engaging project or a nostalgic gamer reliving the past, the Pong Game project promises a delightful gaming experience.

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/): You'll need Python to run this project.

* [Replit](https://replit.com): This project is designed to work with Replit, so you'll need to have a Replit account and be familiar with using it.

* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/): If you prefer running the project locally in PyCharm, make sure to install PyCharm on your system.

* [Turtle Graphics Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html): Ensure that you have the Turtle graphics library installed, which is typically included with Python.

### Installation

Follow these steps to install and run the project:

1. **Python Installation:**
   - Download and install Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Replit Usage:**
   - You can run this project on Replit by following these steps:
     - Create a Replit account if you don't have one.
     - Import the project into Replit or create a new Replit project.
     - Open the main Python script in Replit and run it.

3. **PyCharm Installation and Usage:**
   - Download and install PyCharm from the [official website](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/).
